# GMI2BT_VT22_Lab6
Repo for the last lab of GMI2BT!

For task 1, please run cracker.py

For task 2, please run face_req.py.
The program will first train with about 80% of the total amount of data, then test with about 20% of the data.
It will show individual images (hopefully) with the correct identity along with a confidence level.

Thank you!
